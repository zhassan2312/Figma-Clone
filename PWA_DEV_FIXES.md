# PWA Development Issues - Fixed

## Issue: File System Errors in Development Mode

### Problem:
```
⨯ [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'D:\Development\Projects\Figma-Clone\.next\static\development\_buildManifest.js.tmp.3vj8y5ztryi']
⨯ [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'D:\Development\Projects\Figma-Clone\.next\server\pages\_app\build-manifest.json']
```

### Root Cause:
- PWA service worker was trying to cache build files that don't exist in development mode
- Development builds use different file structures than production builds
- Service worker registration was happening in development even though PWA was disabled

### Solution Applied:

#### 1. Updated Next.js PWA Configuration (`next.config.ts`):
```typescript
const withPWA = require("next-pwa")({
  dest: "public",
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development", // ✅ Disabled in dev
  // Only include runtime caching in production
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && {
    runtimeCaching: [
      {
        urlPattern: /^https?.*/,
        handler: "NetworkFirst",
        options: {
          cacheName: "offlineCache",
          expiration: {
            maxEntries: 200,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
  buildExcludes: [/middleware-manifest.json$/],
  publicExcludes: ["!noprecache/**/*"],
});
```

#### 2. Updated PWA Hook (`src/hooks/usePWA.ts`):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Skip PWA functionality in development mode
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of PWA logic
}, []);
```

#### 3. Cache Cleanup:
- Removed `.next` directory to clear development cache
- Removed generated service worker files from previous builds

### Results:
- ✅ **Development Mode**: No file system errors, PWA features disabled
- ✅ **Production Mode**: Full PWA functionality with service worker generation
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: Different behavior for dev vs prod environments
- ✅ **No Cache Conflicts**: Development builds don't interfere with PWA caching

### Key Benefits:
1. **Smooth Development**: No more file system errors during development
2. **Proper Environment Handling**: PWA features only active in production
3. **Better Performance**: No unnecessary service worker overhead in development
4. **Easier Debugging**: Clear separation between dev and prod PWA behavior

### Testing:
- **Development**: `npm run dev` - No PWA features, no errors
- **Production**: `npm run build` - Full PWA with service worker generation
- **Offline Testing**: Only works in production build as intended
