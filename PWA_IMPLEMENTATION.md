# PWA Implementation for Figma Clone

This document describes the Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation added to the Figma Clone project, including offline support and connectivity warning features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. PWA Configuration
- **next-pwa**: Integrated next-pwa package for service worker generation and PWA functionality
- **Service Worker**: Automatically generated service worker with caching strategies
- **Web App Manifest**: Comprehensive manifest.json with app metadata, icons, and shortcuts

### 2. Offline Support
- **Network-First Caching**: Implements a network-first strategy that falls back to cache when offline
- **Offline Warning**: Displays a prominent red banner when no internet connection is detected
- **Automatic Detection**: Uses navigator.onLine API and online/offline events for real-time status

### 3. PWA Installation
- **Install Prompt**: Custom install prompt that appears when the app can be installed
- **Platform Detection**: Detects if the app is already running as an installed PWA
- **Update Notifications**: Shows notification when app updates are available

### 4. User Experience Enhancements
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear warning message stating "No internet connection - Your changes will not be saved"
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized with proper viewport and touch handling
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for showing/hiding offline warning

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/components/OfflineWarning.tsx` - Displays offline status warning
2. `src/components/PWAInstaller.tsx` - Handles PWA installation logic
3. `src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` - User interface for install prompts
4. `src/hooks/usePWA.ts` - Custom hook for PWA functionality
5. `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest configuration

### Modified Files:
1. `next.config.ts` - Added PWA configuration
2. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added PWA components and meta tags
3. `src/styles/globals.css` - Added PWA-specific styles
4. `package.json` - Added next-pwa dependency

## Technical Implementation

### Service Worker Strategy
```javascript
runtimeCaching: [
  {
    urlPattern: /^https?.*/,
    handler: "NetworkFirst",
    options: {
      cacheName: "offlineCache",
      expiration: {
        maxEntries: 200,
      },
    },
  },
]
```

### Offline Detection
The app uses multiple methods to detect connectivity:
- `navigator.onLine` API for initial state
- `online` and `offline` event listeners for real-time updates
- Visual feedback with red warning banner

### Caching Strategy
- **Network First**: Tries network request first, falls back to cache if offline
- **Cache Management**: Limits cache to 200 entries to prevent storage bloat
- **Automatic Updates**: Service worker updates automatically with new deployments

## User Benefits

1. **Offline Access**: Users can continue using the app even without internet connection
2. **Visual Feedback**: Clear warning about offline status and unsaved changes
3. **App-like Experience**: Can be installed as a native app on mobile/desktop
4. **Improved Performance**: Cached resources load faster on repeat visits
5. **Automatic Updates**: App automatically updates when new versions are available

## Browser Support

The PWA features work in:
- Chrome/Chromium browsers (full support)
- Firefox (limited PWA support)
- Safari on iOS (limited PWA support)
- Edge (full support)

## Development vs Production

- **Development**: PWA features are disabled to avoid caching issues during development
- **Production**: Full PWA functionality is enabled with service worker registration

## Usage Instructions

1. **Building for Production**: Run `npm run build` to generate service worker and PWA assets
2. **Testing Offline**: Use browser developer tools to simulate offline conditions
3. **Installation**: Visit the site in a PWA-capable browser to see install prompts
4. **Updates**: When you deploy new versions, users will be prompted to update

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Background sync for saving changes when connection is restored
2. Push notifications for collaborative features
3. Advanced caching strategies for different asset types
4. Offline-specific UI components and functionality
5. Better icon assets in multiple sizes for different platforms

## Update Log - July 7, 2025

### ✅ Fixed Next.js 15 Metadata Warnings
- **Issue**: Next.js 15 deprecated `themeColor` and `viewport` in metadata exports
- **Solution**: Moved to separate `viewport` export as recommended
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/layout.tsx`

### Changes Made:
```typescript
// Before (deprecated)
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  themeColor: "#000000",
  viewport: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no",
  // ... other metadata
};

// After (Next.js 15 compliant)
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  width: "device-width",
  initialScale: 1,
  maximumScale: 1,
  userScalable: false,
  themeColor: "#000000",
};
```

### Results:
- ✅ Eliminated metadata configuration warnings
- ✅ Build completes successfully without warnings
- ✅ PWA functionality remains intact
- ✅ Proper viewport and theme color configuration
